          Having started my hunt for a new job after returning from traveling I decided a website would be a good way to document various projects i've completed and present further information about myself that doesn't fit on a CV. However, being a developer, I figured a wordpress website wouldn't suffice, and set out to make my own website from scratch using HTML CSS and Javascript. <br><br>

          I have some experience in XAML which could be loosely mapped onto HTML, but I had never done any web development before beginning this project, so I was very much learning on the go, using online tutorials from places such as W3schools and Youtube to get the basics of dynamic web design and nested layouts down. <br><br>

          As I built out the shell of the website I started to have fun experimenting with some Javascript functionality, introducing fade animations when entering pages and randomizing some parts of the website like the text on the landing page when refreshed. Despite the syntax being different, these Javascript functions are definitely the most similar to the coding I am used to in languages like Python and C#, and are where I felt the most confident to experiment and have some fun seeing what I could come up with and achieve. <br><br>

          The website is still very much an ongoing project and I hope to continue updating it, adding further projects I have worked on, as well as experimenting on the website itself with different web design features, ways to display information, and hopefully some more fun Javascript.
