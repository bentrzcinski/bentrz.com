          During university I collaborated with a friend on a series of game jam projects. We used the game development software Godot and wrote our code in GDScript, which has a similar syntax to Python, but allows easier integration of built in Godot tools such as physics engines. <br><br>

          Crack the case was our second attempt at a game jam and we were lucky enough to be joined by a friend who was studying graphic design and game art, so we took full advantage and decided to create a story and pixel-art focused exploration game. <br><br>

          We had 48 hours to create the game from scratch including all the artwork. We worked over two days from our little home office and rushed up until the deadline to polish off the game. <br><br>
